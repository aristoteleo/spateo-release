###########################


def ball_pivoting_mesh(pc: PolyData, radii: List[float] = None):
    """
    Computes a triangle mesh from an oriented point cloud based on the ball pivoting algorithm.
    Algorithm Overview:
        The main assumption this algorithm is based on is the following: Given three vertices, and a ball of radius r,
        the three vertices form a triangle if the ball is getting "caught" and settle between the points, without
        containing any other point.
        The algorithm stimulates a virtual ball of radius r. Each iteration consists of two steps:
            * Seed triangle - The ball rolls over the point cloud until it gets "caught" between three vertices and
                              settles between in them. Choosing the right r promises no other point is contained in the
                              formed triangle. This triangle is called "Seed triangle".
            * Expanding triangle - The ball pivots from each edge in the seed triangle, looking for a third point. It
                                   pivots until it gets "caught" in the triangle formed by the edge and the third point.
                                   A new triangle is formed, and the algorithm tries to expand from it. This process
                                   continues until the ball can't find any point to expand to.
        At this point, the algorithm looks for a new seed triangle, and the process described above starts all over.
    Useful Notes:
        1. The point cloud is "dense enough";
        2. The chosen r size should be "slightly" larger than the average space between points.

    Args:
        pc: A point cloud model.
        radii: The radii of the ball that are used for the surface reconstruction.
               This is a list of multiple radii that will create multiple balls of different radii at the same time.

        width: Specifies the target width of the finest level octree cells.
               This parameter is ignored if depth is specified.
        scale: Specifies the ratio between the diameter of the cube used for reconstruction and the diameter of the
