    Perform hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage on an array

    This function runs in two steps. First, it computes a Ward linkage tree
    by calling :func:`sklearn.cluster.ward_tree`, with `return_distance=True`,
    which yields distances between clusters. then, if `distance_threshold` is not
    provided, a dynamic threshold is calculated by finding the inflection (knee)
    of the distance (x) vs number of clusters (y) line using the top 1000
    distances, making the assumption that for the vast majority of cases, there
    will be less than 1000 density clusters.

    """Segment into regions by UMI density.

    The tissue is segmented into UMI density bins according to the following
    procedure.
    1. The UMI matrix is binned according to `binsize` (recommended >= 20).
    2. The binned UMI matrix (from the previous step) is Gaussian blurred with
        kernel size `k`. Note that `k` is in terms of bins, not pixels.
    3. The elements of the blurred, binned UMI matrix is hierarchically clustered
        with Ward linkage, distance threshold `distance_threshold`, and spatial
        constraints (immediate neighbors). This yields pixel density bins
        (a.k.a. labels) the same shape as the binned matrix.
    4. Each density bin is diluted with kernel size `dk`, starting from the
        bin with the smallest mean UMI (a.k.a. least dense) and going to
        the bin with the largest mean UMI (a.k.a. most dense). This is done in
        an effort to mitigate RNA diffusion and "choppy" borders in subsequent
        steps.
    5. If `background` is not provided, the density bin that is most common in the
        perimeter of the matrix is selected to be background, and thus its label
        is changed to take a value of 0. A pixel can be manually selected to be
        background by providing a `(x, y)` tuple instead. This feature can be
        turned off by providing `False`.
    6. The density bin matrix is resized to be the same size as the original UMI
        matrix.

    Args:
        adata: Input Anndata
        layer: Layer that contains UMI counts to segment based on.
        binsize: Size of bins to use. For density segmentation, pixels are binned
            to reduce runtime. 20 is usually a good starting point. Note that this
            value is relative to the original binsize used to read in the
            AnnData.
        k: Kernel size for Gaussian blur, in bins
        dk: Kernel size for final dilation, in bins
        distance_threshold: Distance threshold for the Ward linkage
            such that clusters will not be merged if they have
            greater than this distance.
        background: Pixel that should be categorized as background. By
            default, the bin that is most assigned to the outermost pixels are
            categorized as background. Set to False to turn off background detection.
